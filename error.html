<h4 id="exceptioncode1ifnullreturned">Exception Code 1 - if null returned</h4>

<pre><code>[index] ?? '' # data, if null, 'x'
</code></pre>

<p>The Widget/.builder is unable to display the data pulled from the model class. If you are a developer, check the code pulling data from the model class. If you are an end user, contact the developer of Train Facts.</p>

<h4 id="exceptioncode2nointernet">Exception Code 2 - No Internet</h4>

<p>Either the device is unable to connect to the Internet, or the backend API has (most likely syntax) an error. If you are a developer, open your JSON file and check for missing commas, etc. If you are an end user, ensure you are connected to the Internet upon app startup. It will not automatically reconnect afterwards and you will have to restart the app if you connect to the Internet later.</p>

<h3 id="yellowtextonredbackgroundruntimeerror">Yellow Text on Red Background (Runtime error)</h3>

<p>The app has encountered a serious error, that was originally considered typesafe. Contact the developer of Train Facts, or <a href="https://github.com/TrainFacts/">file an issue on GitHub</a></p>

<h3 id="webviewnotworkingtranslateblogsite">WebView not working (Translate, Blog site)</h3>

<p>You are most likely not connected to the Internet. Alternatively, the website is down. </p>
